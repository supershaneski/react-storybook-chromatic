react-storybook-chromatic
================

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This sample is a rework of the [Storybook](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started/) tutorial and I made it as an exercise while learning Storybook and testing [Chromatic](https://docs.chromaticqa.com/test). 

I also added some more functions like **Add New Task** to make life more ~~difficult~~ interesting.

## Know Bug
I use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) components and when you open the dialog box for **Add New Task** some [warning](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/13394) will be shown in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run storybook`

Starts the Storybook component explorer on port 9009.
